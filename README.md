### Summary

teller (™️) was born out of the desire to eliminate the barrier to entry into the cryptocurrency world, and present assets and market research in an intuitive way.

teller simplifies the data-gathering process that comes with researching currencies and analyzes current trends to help guide users to a more informed investing experience.

By compiling all of this information into one place, users can feel confident in having done their due diligence.

## Challenges

#### TravisCI

Configuration was not intuitive and we spent more time figuring out configuration for Travis than should have been necessary.

#### Learning a New Language / Framework

Learning Python and Django was a task in and of itself, but Autumn spent time figuring data in D3/Plotly

#### Connecting Projects

Although conceptually it was not difficult, we ran into more than a few bugs that slowed our connections between backend and frontend.

## Future Iterations

Websockets - We hope to have a live stream of market price changes soon, hopefully before demo night

TellerAI Comparitive Analysis - We had hoped to create our own machine learning feature and use it to compare against Watson's AI. More to come

Database with Background Jobs - The biggest drawback to our backend is that it relies on pulling from the external APIs. We hope to implement background workers to fill our database with recent information in case of an API outage

GraphQL - We hope to wrap REST API's in GraphQL to consolidate interactions with backend.
